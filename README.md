#Test your chef recipies before deploying them to opsworks

So you want to create chef recipes that provision aws opsworks? well first you'll need to test them locally. This project is an example that provisions a Vagrant VM with the default opsworks recipes and a starting point to build and test your own.

#installation
install Vagrant, Virtualbox, Vagrant-Berkshelf plugin. After installing I got:

    
    Vagrant -v
    Vagrant 1.7.2
    
    Vagrant plugin list
    vagrant-berkshelf (4.0.2)
    vagrant-share (1.1.3, system)
    
    ruby -v
    ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]

This depends on the box file from this project https://github.com/wwestenbrink/vagrant-opsworks
clone vagrant-opsworks seprately, it's dependencies and build the box file, I tested with commit `da9f341197`

once finished you shouuld get this:

    vagrant box list

    ubuntu1204-opsworks (virtualbox, 0)

# Running
if all went well, run

    vagrant up --provision

    vagrant ssh

    cat /home/example-file

If everything succeeded, default.rb created that file! Log in to opsworks, make sure it runs there too. Test your own recipes. Happy devop-ing!
